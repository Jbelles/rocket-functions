# rocket-functions
A small sample API and console app for interacting with the Stellar .net core SDK.

This app contains a few demo functions of using the .Net Core Stellar SDK and gives some example architecture of how it might be used.
It also contains a fully functional console app for identifying a successful inflation operation paying out all voters 100% of their inflation contribution to a specified pool.
